# Heliconia_removal_Hummingbird_persistence

Analyses for [hummingbird persistence manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.24.481682v2) (second chapter of dissertation)

**Question** 

How do hummingbirds respond after a plant species is lost from the community? Do they abandon the area, or do they expand their diet to feed on new plant species â€“ thus allowing them to persist? 

And does loss of a common plant species cause cascading effects for the pollination success of the remaining flowering plants?

**Approach**

I temporarily removed the inflorescences of a locally common flowering plant, *Heliconia tortuosa*, from forested study sites surrounding the Las Cruces Biological Station in southern Costa Rica. This experiment followed a Before-After-Control-Impact design.

I gathered data on hummingbird abundance, space use, and plant-hummingbird interactions using four complementary approaches:

1.	Mist net captures
    -	Number of hummingbirds captured

2.	Movements of radio-tagged hummingbirds
    -	Proportion of time spent in removal area

3.	Trail cameras positioned at flowering plants
    -	Number of visits per hour

4.	Plant pollination success
    -	Proportion of flowers pollinated

To determine whether *Heliconia* removal affected these response varaibles, I conducted statistical analyses using generalized linear mixed models (Poisson, betabinomial, and negative binomial families).

**Results**

No evidence that hummingbirds changed their movements and foraging patterns to cope with removal of a locally common resource. Similarly, no evidence of changes in plant pollination success.

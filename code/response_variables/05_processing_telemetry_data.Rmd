**Overall goal**

Get these data ready for analysis. It's a bit of a process, because each row is a bird's GPS location, and hummingbirds move very quickly; sometimes not all the data were recorded in the field, or were recorded incorrectly.

**Specific goals**

- Continue cleaning telemetry data, with focus on spatial data

- Use direction and distance to project coordinates (i.e. calculate bird's location using trigonometric relationships)

- Score whether bird in focal area or not

- Visualize data using tmap

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

library(lubridate) #Need to load before raster, because otherwise will mask 'intersect'
library(sf)
library(raster) #Need to load before dplyr, because otherwise will mask 'select'
library(tmap)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(purrr)
```

## Step 1: Get data
```{r, get_data}
#These data have already had some initial cleaning, at least enough to allow years to be joined together
telem_data <- read.csv("../../data/import/Telemetry_data_2016-2018_20220603.csv") %>%
  select(-X)

#Get focal area outlines, for determining whether or not a GPS point was in the patch
#Here, "patch" and "focal area" are used interchangeably
focal_area_outlines <- sf::st_read("../../data/export/intermediate/focal_areas_2016-2018.shp")

#Net location info, for determining centroid of area where bird caught (and radio-tagged)
nets <- read.csv("../../data/import/Nets_2016-2018_20210909.csv")
```

## Step 2: Do some QA/QC

Identify incorrect/illogical combinations of distance and direction
```{r, check_distance_and_direction}
#Check: if distance is 0, direction should be NA. 
check01 <- telem_data %>%
  filter(distance == 0) %>%
  distinct(direction)

check01

#Check: if a direction is present with distance zero, this implies that distance of 0 is incorrect
#Already converted these distances to NA in Excel to make sure I do not use these points
check02 <- telem_data %>%
  mutate(across(c(distance, direction), as.numeric)) %>%
  filter(distance == 0 & direction > 0)
```

Check for missing GPS data
```{r, check_missing_gps_data}
#Missing GPS coordinates
#This typically occurred when landmarks, like nets, were recorded but we didn't record net locations. Also when one of GPS coordinates was deemed inaccurate
missing_coords <- telem_data %>%
  filter(x_utm == "" | is.na(x_utm) | y_utm == "" | is.na(y_utm))

missing_coords_by_observer <- missing_coords %>%
  group_by(year, observer) %>%
  summarise(num_missing_points = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_missing_points))

#Missing distances (if no distance, will not result in projected GPS coord, i.e., will lose these data)
#This typically occured when there was no signal or when start/end times were being recorded.
missing_distances <- telem_data %>%
  filter(distance == "" | is.na(distance))

missing_distances_by_observer <- missing_distances %>%
  group_by(year, observer) %>%
  summarise(num_missing_points = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_missing_points))

#Missing directions are only a problem distances over a given threshold - under this, and can just use original coordinate if needed).
#Decision: 20-m is distance threshold. If direction is missing and distance <20, it's OK
missing_directions <- telem_data %>%
  filter(direction == "" | is.na(direction)) %>%
  filter(as.numeric(distance) > 20)

missing_directions_by_observer <- missing_directions %>%
  group_by(year, observer) %>%
  summarise(num_missing_points = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(num_missing_points))

#Missing GPS data, combined
missing_gps_data <- missing_coords %>%
  bind_rows(missing_distances) %>%
  bind_rows(missing_directions) %>%
  distinct()

#Note: On 12/27/2018, I checked 2016-2017 missing data (gps x, gps y, distance, direction) against notebooks available. No way to check for additional 2018 data because collected on phone.
```

## Step 3: Project coordinates

To convert compass bearing (direction) and distance into GPS coordinates, use trigonometry. But note that trigonometic functions in R use radians, NOT degrees! Multiply degrees by pi/180 to convert degrees to radians.

There are multiple ways to project the coordinates. The simplest way uses the unit circle, but the unit circle starts in a different place from where compass starts (it is offset 90 degrees clockwise from compass "north") and also goes counter-clockwise (vs. clockwise with compass). This can be handled by subtracted the compass angle from 90 degrees.

![unit circle](../../data/import/unit_circle.png)

DECISION: If direction is missing but distance is less than 20m, just use original (non-projected) GPS coords instead of removing the data entirely.

```{r, project_coordinates}
#Keep original coordinates if distance is zero **OR** if there is no direction info but distance is less than or equal to 20m. Otherwise, attempt to project (will not be able project if missing distance or direction)
telem_data02 <- telem_data %>%
  mutate(across(c("x_utm", "y_utm", "distance", "direction"), as.numeric)) %>%
  mutate(x_displace = distance * cos((90 - direction) * pi/180),
         y_displace = distance * sin((90 - direction) * pi/180),
         x_utm_proj = ifelse(distance == 0 | (distance <= 20 & (is.na(direction) | direction == "")), x_utm, x_utm + x_displace),
         y_utm_proj = ifelse(distance == 0 | (distance <= 20 & (is.na(direction) | direction == "")), y_utm, y_utm + y_displace))

#Check: why are certain projected coordinates NA? Should only be NA if missing GPS coords, distance, or direction.
check03 <- telem_data02 %>%
  select(year, patch, date, observer, species, frequency, notes_location_english, notes_data, x_utm, y_utm, distance, direction, x_displace, y_displace, x_utm_proj, y_utm_proj) %>%
  filter(x_utm_proj == "" | is.na(x_utm_proj) | y_utm_proj == "" | is.na(y_utm_proj))
```

## Step 4: Do some more QA/QC

Identify suspect GPS coordinates
```{r, check_coordinates}
#Of the projected coordinates, which ones are really off base?
#First, check for coordinates that are REALLY out of bounds. This will include coordinates with too few or too many digits.
#x coords should be 276000-296000
#y coords should be 962000-978000 
out_of_bound_coords <- telem_data02 %>%
  filter(x_utm_proj < 276000 | x_utm_proj > 296000 | y_utm_proj < 962000 | y_utm_proj > 978000)

#Next, check for coordinates that are out of bounds given the context (i.e., patch).
#Create mean center summary for nets from capture #1 in each patch
#Net mean center summary
net_centers <- nets %>%
  select(-X) %>%
  mutate_all(as.character) %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(date)) %>%
  distinct(year, patch, date, exp_phase, net_number, x_utm, y_utm) %>%
  filter(exp_phase == "capture_1") %>%
  group_by(year, patch) %>%
  summarise(mean_x = mean(as.numeric(x_utm), na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_y = mean(as.numeric(y_utm), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(mean_x))

#Check any points more than 1000m away from mean center of net locations in that patch (this was roughly where bird was caught).
#These extremely distant points only seem to occur when signal is very weak/bird is very far away.
outlier_coords_1000 <- telem_data02 %>%
  mutate_all(as.character) %>%
  left_join(net_centers) %>%
  filter(x_utm_proj >= mean_x + 1000 |
         x_utm_proj <= mean_x - 1000 |
         y_utm_proj >= mean_y + 1000 |
         y_utm_proj <= mean_y - 1000)
```

## Step 5: Score whether point (bird) was in focal area or not

I will do this in two ways:

1. With spatial data. This is primary way. Is the bird's GPS coordinate within the focal area outline?

2. With written notes. This is only used if bird is missing a complete set of GPS coordinates.

**Use spatial data**
```{r, score_bird_with_spatial_data}
#Patch = 'focal area' outline (100% MCP of resource count coordinates)
#Make telemetry points spatial. Only want the row_id and the coordinates, with missing coordinate values removed
points <- telem_data02 %>%
  select(row_id, year, patch, x_utm_proj, y_utm_proj) %>%
  unite("id", patch, year, sep = ".", remove = TRUE) %>%
  filter(!is.na(x_utm_proj) & !is.na(y_utm_proj))

#Make telemetry points into spatial (sf) object. use "identity" when the attributes uniquely identifies the geometry of particular "thing"
points_utm <- sf::st_as_sf(points, coords = c("x_utm_proj", "y_utm_proj"), crs = 32617, agr = "identity")

#Make sure focal area outlines are in UTM
focal_area_outlines_utm <- sf::st_transform(focal_area_outlines, crs = 32617) %>%
  select(-id, -mcp_prc) %>%
  unite("id", patch, year, sep = ".")
  
#st_join joins points to outlines for ALL years, so have to remove duplicates by fitering to matches. argument 'left' returns an inner join if FALSE
points_in_patches <- sf::st_join(points_utm, focal_area_outlines_utm, join = st_within, left = FALSE) %>% #
  filter(id.x == id.y) %>% 
  rename(id = id.x) %>% #Keep this for plotting function
  select(-id.y) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>% #If you want to remove the geometry column and transform an sf object to a data frame or tibble, you can use as_tibble() or as.data.frame() in a pipe before select()
  select(-geometry) %>%
  mutate(point_in_patch_spatial = 1)

points_not_in_patches <- points %>%
  filter(!(row_id %in% points_in_patches$row_id)) %>%
  mutate(point_in_patch_spatial = 0) %>%
  select(row_id, point_in_patch_spatial)

point_info_to_add <- points_in_patches %>%
  bind_rows(points_not_in_patches)

#Add points back into telemetry data based on row_id
telem_data03 <- telem_data02 %>%
  left_join(point_info_to_add) %>%
  select(row_id:direction, contains("utm"), contains("point_in"), everything())
```

**Use notes to score in/out of patch for rows missing GPS coordinates**

At the very least, I can code whether the bird was in/out of patch (focal area) based on the written notes. For example, keywords like 'net', 'pole', 'station' would indicate that bird was in patch and/or near a net pole. These data could be useful for calculating time in patch later on, though it would not solve the problem of very few points for home range calculations.

Scoring based on the keyword 'patch'/'in patch' is difficult, because there are many variations of this (e.g., 'going to patch', 'returning from patch', 'in a different patch', 'not in patch', 'left the patch', etc.)

```{r, score_bird_using_written_notes}
#Verbatim comments that can be used to score in/out of patch **when GPS data are missing**. Did not include comments saying that bird was 'leaving/going toward/returning to patch', only comments that implied bird was in the patch at the recorded time.
in_patch_comments <- c("in patch", 
                       "Back in patch - confirmed by ASH",
                       "briefly in patch, <50m from net 20",
                       "came through patch and left down toward houses",
                       "Weak signal inside patch 58, looking for 725",
                       "He was in a HETO plant. I managed to observe it. It was a lot of time in the patch",
                       "Saw bird fly from Station 1 to HETO in front of Camera 13. Did not drink. Headed NE",
                       "still inside the p58 he moves in search of HETO flowers",
                       "It is inside the patch")

#Add info based on these comments and combine columns with information about in/out of patch (i.e., from notes and from spatial overlap)
telem_data04 <- telem_data03 %>%
  mutate(point_in_patch_from_notes = ifelse(row_id %in% missing_gps_data$row_id & grepl("net|pole|focal#1|focal#2|corner", notes_location_english, ignore.case = TRUE), 1, NA)) %>%
  mutate(point_in_patch_from_notes = ifelse(row_id %in% missing_gps_data$row_id & (notes_location_english %in% in_patch_comments), 1, point_in_patch_from_notes)) %>% 
  mutate(point_in_patch = ifelse(row_id %in% missing_gps_data$row_id, point_in_patch_from_notes, point_in_patch_spatial)) %>% 
  select(row_id:direction, contains("utm"), contains("point_in"), everything())
```

## Step 6: Visualize data
```{r, visualize_data}
#Quick visualization check
#Use purr to filter data for each patch-year combination, then make plot.
#Would not work just with tmap() facets. Maybe because of missing points for some patches? Still not sure.
filter_to_patch_year <- function(year_id, patch_id, data_type){
  
  if(data_type == "patches"){data <- focal_area_outlines_utm}
  if(data_type == "points"){data <- points_utm}

  result <- data %>%
    separate(id, c("patch", "year"), remove = FALSE) %>%
    filter(patch == patch_id & year == year_id)
  
  return(result)
}

make_map <- function(patches, points){

  num_points <- dim(points)[[1]]
  
  #If there are points to plot...
  if(num_points != 0){
    tm_shape(patches) +
      tm_polygons(col = "lightgrey", alpha = 0.5) +
    tm_shape(points) +
      tm_symbols(col = "black", size = 1, alpha = 1)
  }
  
  #If there are no points...returns NULL
}

maps <- telem_data04 %>%
  distinct(year, patch) %>% #Get a list of years and patches
  mutate(patches = map2(year, patch, ~filter_to_patch_year(.x, .y, data_type = "patches"))) %>%
  mutate(points = map2(year, patch, ~filter_to_patch_year(.x, .y, data_type = "points"))) %>%
  mutate(maps = map2(patches, points, ~make_map(.x, .y)))

maps$maps
```

## Step 7: Export data
```{r, export_data}
write.csv(telem_data04, "../../data/export/intermediate/Telemetry_data_2016-2018_projected_coords.csv") 
```

*Note: for analysis, will still need to filter out rows with missing data. But, some of these rows have information about telemetry effort, so leaving them in here for now.*
